> Perhaps the purpose of life is "to be" and not necessarily always "to do".

As I think about how I would like to have my college life unfold, I've been rethinking my relationship with time. Being someone who likes
soaking advice from books, I turned to '4000 weeks' by Oliver Burkeman in search of a better understanding of what exactly does it mean 
to spend time wisely.

Filled with practical insights, Oliver has a unique way of not sounding prescriptive. Instead, he lays his ideas on the table and makes you do the work of thinking for yourself. So for this reflection, I will be noting down my favorite takeaways from this book and conclude by jotting down my thoughts on its influence on how I view time today.

## Embracing Finitude
The book does not fail to constantly remind human finitude - that there are infinite tasks, possiblities, and endeavors we can take on, but can only grasp a finite supply of time and energy. Oliver indicates how embracing this finitude may seem like surrendering to the lords of to-do lists, but when we finally grasp the true essence of our finitude, we can truly dedicate our energy to things that matter the most to us. 

He mentions how we postpone working on meaningful projects or creating special moments in our personal relationships to strive towards the content future self who has everything figured out. This results in delaying meaningful moments for an imaginary and unpromised point in future. It is somehow ironic that our goal remains the same. We're still finding contentment. However, by denying these moments to ourselves in the present moment and postponing it for our future self, we are constantly chasing a point in the future where we assume that we will finally be happy. In the anticipation of a more fulfilled and controlled future self, we're almost always like weary travelers walking towards a mirage in a desert. By realizing that our time is limited and making choices, instead of having choices being made on their own - we are able to work towards a meaningful present instead of working towards an idealistic future, whose problem-free outlook might be beyond our grasp.

## Intentional Pause
Taking an intentional pause is not about leaving off to the woods and staying async with reality. Instead, it is about embracing the true reason why you are working on a specific task. It speaks about how we rush through our to-do lists, thinking that once we reach to the end of it, we will feel better about ourselves. 

This puts our self-worth in the unreliable hands of life-long never-ending to-do list, where we constantly strive to tick those tasks off to secure our sense of contentment. This cycle takes us away from intentionally living our day - where our overemphasis on tasks prevents us from truly enjoying the present moment.

We can again tie the idea of intentional pauses to embracing our finitude. Since we have a finite amount of time and energy to spare, it is important that we take the time to intentionally pause and check in with ourselves. Are we rushing through the tasks to achieve a sense of accomplishment or are we pursuing the tasks that truly add meaning to our days?
