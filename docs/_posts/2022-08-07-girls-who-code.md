This summer, I decided to spend my time motivating other female-identifying individuals towards pursuing their interests in Computer Science. As a first-generation student myself, I've always been subconsciously cognizant of whether I feel included in a room. This was my time to create that inclusive environment for others. 

When I first moved to the US, I learned pretty early on that the definition of diversity needs to be reflected upon a bit more. Diversity is not about bringing different-looking individuals to the table. It is about giving them the equal opportunity and voice to make decisions at that table. Through my experience at Girls Who Code, I look for opportunities where I can give equal consideration to students who come from incredibly diverse backgrounds. Step-by-step, I try to teach them - not just how to add hover interactivity to their websites using JavaScript, but how they can talk about their code, discuss their thought process, and think about improvements in their code while they are reviewing it. 

While teaching them how to code, I learn how to develop code. Well, you might ask me, how did you become a Teaching Assistant if you didn't know how to code. I do know how to code. But I learned that there is a difference between coding and developing code. 

> Developing code is about communication - not just to the computer, but also with the people you are working with. 

I learn through my occasional errors during coding demos where I do not just learn how to fix my code, but to communicate that I don't know all the ins and outs of programming. By admitting that I still have a long path to traverse, I watch my ego subside. It's easier to make mistakes and learn from them. Plus, I get to show other students that one journey of learning is through making mistakes and learning from them.
